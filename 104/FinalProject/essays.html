		<h3><em>Question 1</em></h3>
			<p><strong>Please provide a statement that addresses your reasons for transferring and the objectives you hope to achieve. You can type directly into the box, or you can paste text from another source. (Approximately 650 words)</strong></p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>Connections shape my world. I love to entertain myself with logic and thinking through relationships, specifically processing and reaping the reward of solving puzzles. Whether it's analyzing books and movies, building LEGOs, or doing art, I find myself intrigued with how kaleidoscopes of patterns contribute to bigger pictures. This past year of unexpected circumstances has matured me in the way I view myself and the world. I learned to strengthen my connections and treasure my time with friends, family, and most importantly, myself. I want to continue using every opportunity to explore new grounds both personally and as a student. USC is the next step forward that will challenge me and help me piece my future together as I mature and find ways to contribute to my society.</p>

				<p>As an Irvine Valley College commuter, I cherished extra time at home and tackled more responsibilities like caring for Owen, our guide dog in training, and tutoring my brother and family friends in calculus and chemistry. I learned to really appreciate the little parts of life I know I'll miss when the time comes to move out. I love hearing Owen's tail smack the stairway railing and watch his eyes light up as he awaits my greeting, and I've grown to await the sound of the garage door slamming open as my dad's booming voice fills the room, asking about new anime or movies to watch. Moreover, I earned my license and earned more confidence in my abilities on the road, adding to my growing independence and allowing me to build a close, comfortable circle with friends attending local colleges. This was not where I pictured myself last year while applying to colleges, but I could never trade my extra time in the warmth and comfort of home for anything else.</p>

				<p>Being too comfortable can hinder growth though. At USC, I'm ready to find a purpose and discover what I can do for myself and people around me. Irvine Valley College has prepared me to transfer by providing me the foundation I need to take my education to the next level. I focused especially on solidifying my knowledge in calculus and economics, and with the knowledge I've built, I am determined to continue adding to my education through USC's engaging, rigorous courses. While Irvine Valley College offers a variety of majors, I know USC has an even greater selection of majors that I wish to explore. After touring USC this past summer, their open class policy instantly intrigued me as it would allow me to explore different interests. Although I plan to study economics, I would love to get involved and express my passions for drawing and singing in one of USC's ensemble choirs, such as USC CreSCendo Vocal Jazz Ensemble or Keck's Art Club. I look forward to getting involved with SC's vast selection of clubs, meeting new people, and bonding over shared hobbies.</p>

				<p>While being a commuter at IVC had its benefits, there was not a lot of school pride. One of the qualities I admire most about USC and why it has been my dream school is the community that staff, faculty, and students create for each other. The way Trojans support each other up and cheer each other on no matter what, and in all aspects of life, from athletics to the professional workplace, is inspiring. I'm eager to show my school pride and bond with other Trojans, both students and alumni, who all have a unique story to tell. USC's strong alumni network gives me opportunities to connect with and learn from the Trojan family, just as I have learned from my Trojan parents. I look forward to the chance to hear about their failures, successes, the lessons they learned, and how they got to where they are. As I continue putting together the pieces of my life's puzzle, I dream of watching my future unfold in cardinal and gold.</p>

		<h3><em>Question 2</em></h3>
			<p><strong>USC faculty place an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic opportunities. Describe something outside of your intended academic focus about which you are interested in learning.</strong></p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>Drawing has always been a passion of mine and one I want to dive deeper into with USC's animation and digital arts classes. As a child, whenever my architect grandpa came to visit from Taiwan, I always loved to pester him with drawing requests and sketch lessons. Before I knew it, my free time was filled by black charcoal pencils, dusty pastels, acrylic paint fumes, and more.</p>

				<p>While watercolor was my favorite medium ever since I took art classes during elementary school, it wasn't until the 2020 mandated quarantine that I found myself becoming more interested in animations. Starting as a nostalgic trip down memory lane, I began to watch anime and Disney's animated movies to admire the colors and movements of animations and digital art.</p>

				<p>My first and second choice majors focus on interaction and communicating with others. That is why art has always been a safe place where I could have some "me time'' for some self-expression, where I can process and interact with my environment and learn more about myself. Furthermore, I love that animation and digital art is an inclusive medium that can communicate important lessons without words. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words that can create deep intrinsic connections across cultural and language barriers.</p>

				<p>At USC's School of Cinematic Arts and Roski School of Fine Arts, I want to pursue this passion to learn more and be able to further appreciate the hard work that was put into my favorite shows and movies, maybe even creating some of my own works. I really look forward to learning more in classes like "Writing For Animation" or "Animation Theory and Techniques" that will teach me how to create my own stories to convey to others just as many others' stories have touched mine.</p>

			<h3><em>Question 3</em></h3>
				<p><strong>Describe how you plan to pursue your academic interests and why you want to explore them at USC specifically. Please feel free to address your first- and second-choice major selections. (Approximately 250 words)</strong></p>

				<div class="answer">
				<p>I want to learn how I can do my part in this world. While accompanying my parents to a meeting with our banker, I was enlightened by how much there is to learn about finances and the benefits of good money management. I'm eager to explore more through USC's abundant resources, classes, and research opportunities. I would love to take "Money, Credit, and Banking" to learn about different markets and their relevance in the real world in addition to "Economics Consulting and Applied Managerial Economics", where I would gain the practical knowledge to help other people understand what I know and assist them in managing their money and choices better. In helping one person at a time understand financial markets, stocks, and asset management, the economy would improve as more efficient practices ensue.</p>

				<p>With the alarming issues of climate change and greenhouse gases, another pathway that fascinates me is environmental studies, especially the integration of environmental studies with economic policies. I want to dig deeper into how economics connects to environmental science and sustainability like learning about what economists can do to help create better policies in "Resource and Environmental Economics." Another particularly interesting topic is cryptocurrency, an increasingly relevant medium of exchange and trade that has a negative environmental impact because of the amount of electricity that's required to mine for digital coins. I look forward to the opportunity to assist in minimizing these costs and maximizing the benefits that ensue. I am also interested in opportunities like USC's Directed Environmental Policy and Science Internship and the U.S. Department of Energy Scholars Program, where I'd get the chance to observe the work of professionals creating greener solutions with science and technology. I plan to use what I learn to spread awareness among my peers and create change.</p>

			<h3><em>Question 4 (Dornsife Required)</em></h3>
				<p><strong>Many of us have at least one issue or passion that we care deeply about – a topic on which we would love to share our opinions and insights in hopes of sparking intense interest and continued conversation. If you had ten minutes and the attention of a million people, what would your talk be about?</strong></p>
			
			<div class="answer">
				<p>While the emergence of social media and prolific internet access has provided an easy way to connect, share, and learn, it also presents challenging obstacles to build genuine relationships with people because of a lack of accountability.</p>

				<p>Not only is sharing opinions common on popular media, but so is retaliation with hostile comments, including death threats and personal attacks. Even worse, people are relentlessly quick to judge without comprehending other people's perspectives. Because commenters are able to hide their identities behind a screen and avoid consequences for their words and actions, others' true thoughts are often hidden, which creates ingenuine connections. Enjoying favorite artists, songs, and shows just isn't the same because rather than having meaningful debates and discussions, people become entitled and animus, forcing their own opinions onto others without allowing them to have their own unique opinions for trivial topics like entertainment. Even when it comes to heavier topics, such as politics and moral dilemmas, where I understand people may have extreme feelings, there's a certain level of respect that needs to be maintained.</p>

				<p>People should be able to express their own opinions on anything from entertainment to politics without fear of insults and harsh words. Listening to people's reasoning and having a civil discussion with constructive communication is vital to understanding each other and creating meaningful connections. We need to remember that behind these screens and posts, there are real people with real feelings and that no opinions should be forced on others.</p>
